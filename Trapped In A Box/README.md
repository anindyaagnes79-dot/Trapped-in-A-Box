# Trapped-in-A-Box

## 🛠️ Developer Guide

This guide is for developers working directly on this repository.

### 1. Project Setup

1.  **Install Godot:** Make sure you have the correct version of **[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/download/) (v4.5.1)** installed.
2.  **Install Git:** If you don't already have it, [download and install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
3.  **Clone the Repository:** On your local machine, open a terminal and run the following command (replace the URL with your project's URL):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anindyaagnes79-dot/Trapped-in-A-Box
    ```
4.  **Navigate into the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd Trapped-In-A-Box
    ```

### 2. Opening in Godot

1.  Open the Godot Project Manager.
2.  Click the **Import** or **Scan** button.
3.  Navigate to the `Trapped-In-A-Box` folder you just cloned and select the `project.godot` file.

### 3. How to Make and Submit Changes (Git Workflow)

We use a "Shared Repository" model. Use a feature branch for your work.

**Step A: Sync with the Main Branch**

Before you start any new work, make sure your local `main` branch is up-to-date.

```bash
# Go to your main branch
git checkout main

# Download the latest changes from the server
git pull origin main

```

**Step B: Create a New Branch**

Create a new, descriptive branch for the feature or bug you are working on.

```bash
# Replace 'my-new-feature' with a descriptive name
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

_(Good names: `fix-steering-bug`, `add-level-3`, `update-horn-sound`)_

**Step C: Make Your Changes & Commit**

1.  Now, open Godot and make all your code, scene, and asset changes (don't forget to add documentation on your code).
2.  Once you've tested your changes, go back to your terminal.
3.  "Stage" your files for a commit:
    ```bash
    # To add all changed files at once
    git add .
    ```
4.  "Commit" your staged files. This saves a snapshot of your changes. Write a clear, short message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Feat: Add a new blocks movement"
    ```
    _(Good commit message prefixes: `Feat:`, `Fix:`, `Refactor:`, `Docs:`)_

**Step D: Push Your Branch to the Repository**

Send your new branch (and all its commits) up to the central repository.

```bash
# This pushes your 'my-new-feature' branch to 'origin' (the main repo)
git push origin my-new-feature
```

**Step E: Open a Pull Request (PR)**

1.  Go to the repository on the GitHub website (e.g., `https://github.com/anindyaagnes79-dot/Trapped-in-A-Box`).
2.  GitHub will see your newly pushed branch and show a yellow bar: "Your branch `my-new-feature` is ready...".
3.  Click the **"Compare & pull request"** button.
4.  Write a clear title and description, and assign any reviewers from your team.
5.  Click **"Create pull request"**.

After the PR is reviewed and approved, it can be merged into `main`.
